# bank-transfer-challenge
We are providing you with a simple REST service with some very basic functionality - to add and read an account.
It is a standard gradle project, running on Spring Boot. It uses Lombok and if you've not come across it before you'll need to configure your
IDE to use it (otherwise code will not compile).
Your task is to add functionality for a transfer of money between accounts. Transfers should be specified by providing:
accountFrom id
accountTo id
amount to transfer between accounts
The amount to transfer should always be a positive number.
It should not be possible for an account to end up with negative balance (we do not support overdrafts!)
Whenever a transfer is made, a notification should be sent to both account holders, with a message containing id of the other account and
amount transferred.
For this purpose please use the NotificationService interface
Do NOT provide implementation for this service - it is assumed another colleague would implement it.
Do not use the provided (simple) implementation in your tests - it is provided for the main application to run. In your tests you should
mock this service.
This feature should be implemented in a thread-safe manner. Your solution should never deadlock, should never result in corrupted account
state, and should work efficiently for multiple transfers happening at the same time.
